I always dreamed of kind of project involving custom hardware and low-level software development. And it looks like your very own Game Console might be the coolest thing to do in the realm, right?

So a year ago I've started looking around and tinkering with some reborn nostalgia consoles like SNES Classic Mini and Analogue Sega built on FPGA as well completely new beasts like virtual console PICO-8.

# CPU

There were two popular CPUs gathered iconic status over the years: MOS 6502 and Zilog Z80. 

The first was used in 8-bit Atari line, Apple computers, Commodore 64, Nintendo NES and many others.

The second went as ZX Spectrum, Amstrad family and some others, popular within Japan and Europe.

I used to own and use many 6502-based systems including Soviet clone of Apple ][, Asian replic of NES and real Ataris and Commodores.

So after some research on history I've decided to use 6502 as my target for Magic brains.

# Screen

Most of 8-bit consoles and computers had screen resolutions around 300x200 pixels for width and height and really poor palletes of around 16 colors. That allowed them to fit into smaller RAM and still had some reasonable graphic within typical NTSC/PAL TV sets.
